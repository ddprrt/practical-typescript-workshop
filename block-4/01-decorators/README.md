# Example 1: Well-Typed Decorators

In this exercise, you'll work with TypeScript 5.0's well-typed decorators. Create a logging decorator that:
1. Logs method parameters before execution
2. Logs the return value after execution

The decorator should preserve the type information of the decorated method.
