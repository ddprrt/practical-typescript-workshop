# Set Theory in TypeScript

## Concept
Set theory forms the foundation of TypeScript's type system. Understanding how types relate to sets helps in grasping more complex type operations.

## Task
Implement functions that demonstrate:
- Subset relationships (extends)
- Empty set (never)
- Universal set (unknown)
- Set operations (union, intersection)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how TypeScript types map to set theory concepts
- Learn how to use basic set operations in types
- Grasp the relationship between types and sets
