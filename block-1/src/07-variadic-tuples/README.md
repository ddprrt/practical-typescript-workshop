Variadic tuple types allow working with tuples of variable length while maintaining type safety.

## Task
Implement utility types and functions that work with variadic tuples.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand variadic tuple syntax
- Create flexible tuple types
- Use spread operators with tuples
