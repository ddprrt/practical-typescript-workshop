# Exercise 2: Intersection Types and Type Predicates

Look at the code in `task.ts` and discuss the following questions:
- What are the problems with the `User` type?
- What are the problems with the narrowing in `getUserPermissions`?

Refactor:
- Make use of intersection types to improve the `User` type
- Make use of discriminated unions to improve the narrowing in `getUserPermissions`
- Create an `isAdmin` function with type predicates that checks if a user is an admin

Compare task and solution.
